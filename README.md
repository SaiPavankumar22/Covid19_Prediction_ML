# COVID-19 Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a **machine learning-based solution** for predicting COVID-19 outcomes based on given datasets. The goal of this project is to analyze and predict the spread or impacts of COVID-19 using various machine learning models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaning and transforming raw data for model training.
  - Handling missing or incomplete values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualization of COVID-19 trends and patterns.
  - Analysis of key features affecting predictions.
- **Model Training**:
  - Implementation of machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis.
  - Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Prediction and Deployment**:
  - Making predictions on test data.
  - Potential deployment for real-time prediction.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above installed on your machine.
- Required libraries installed (see `requirements.txt` or use the command below).

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaiPavankumar22/Covid19_Prediction_ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Covid19_Prediction_ML
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. **Run Data Preprocessing**:
   Use the scripts provided in the `scripts/` folder to clean and preprocess the data.
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess.py
   ```
2. **Model Training**:
   Train the model using provided notebooks or scripts.
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```
3. **Make Predictions**:
   Use the trained model to make predictions on test data.
   ```bash
   python scripts/predict.py
   ```

### Output
Predictions will be saved in the `results/` folder or printed in the console, depending on the configuration.

## Results
- Achieved accuracy of **X%** using [specific model].
- Insights from the EDA include [key findings].

## Future Scope
- Integration with real-time COVID-19 data APIs.
